A tough act to follow
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink
A fly in the ointment
A wrench in the engine
Don't bark up the wrong tree
Skating on thin ice
That ship has sailed
If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound?
Does a bear shit in the woods?
We'll cross that bridge when we get there
Don't burn bridges
A broken clock is right twice a day
This isn't rocket science
This isn't brain surgery
Whatever floats your boat
Don't burn the candle at both ends
Caught between a rock and a hard place
A penny saved is a penny earned
Fun as a barrel of monkeys
Easy as shooting fish in barrel
Straight from the horses mouth
I heard it through the grapevine
You need to strike when the iron is hot
Why buy the cow when you have the milk?
Let's make like a tree and leave
Does the pope wear a funny hat?
You can't squeeze blood from a stone.
